# SoS-Sound-of-Silence

![Alt text](Logo.png)

I developed a system with several friends called "Sos - Sound of Silence" during two days of "Hackaton" contest in software engineering studies. Sos programmed in Java with a GUI built using Scene Builder involves combining Java code with FXML files generated by Scene Builder. For the database we used MySQL workbench. We also used the programmable ESP32 watch, specifically the LILYGO T-WATCH 2021 VI.

## Summary

SoS streamlines emergency calls from a smartwatch to a SQL database, facilitating rapid operator response. The watch is connected to both WiFi and a server, uploading calls through the server to the database. Operators can view all calls on their end.
